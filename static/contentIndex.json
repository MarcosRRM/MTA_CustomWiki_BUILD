Most actions are Instant Actions.\nReflexive Action\nA reflexive action is the sort of thing you don’t even need to think about doing. Most rolls to resist supernatural powers are reflexive. You can take a reflexive action at any time, and it doesn’t take your turn in combat.\nContested Action\nHappens when 2 (or more) people fight over an specific goal, like grappling vs trying to scape, a tug of war, etc.\nYou roll your dice pool and the Storyteller (or other player) rolls the dice pool for the other party. Whoever rolls the most successes is the victor.\nExceptional success still apply to the winner when the number of successes is 5 or higher.\nSpells are not usually Contested but Withstood.\nExtended Actions\nAn extended action is an attempt to complete a complex task. You roll your dice pool multiple times. Each roll takes a certain amount of time, and represents a step in the process — your character either makes significant progress or faces a setback. You determine your dice pool for the action as normal — Attribute + Skill + Modifiers. Make a note of your Attribute + Skill + Specialty (if any); that’s the maximum number of times you can roll before the action fails.\nWhen you take an extended action, the Storyteller determines how many successes you require. Most actions require between five and twenty successes. Five reflects a reasonable action that competent characters can achieve with the right tools and knowledge. Ten represents a difficult action that’s still realistic for a professional in a field. Twenty represents a very difficult action that even a particularly skilled character will have trouble pulling off.\nThe Storyteller also determines the interval between rolls. If an action would take weeks to complete, she might consider one roll per week. If it’s likely to take a day’s work, one roll per hour makes for a solid timeframe.\nResistance to actions\nSometimes, an action is resisted. You roll your Attribute + Skill, but apply a modifier of one of your opponent’s Resistance Attributes (Resolve, Stamina, or Composure), or your opponent’s Defense. This resistance is over and above any other modifiers applied to the dice pool.\nWhen uncanny powers other than Awakened magic are involved, they may be resisted or contested as noted in their rules. Supernatural creatures can sometimes add an additional trait, called Supernatural Tolerance. The Supernatural Tolerance trait for Mages is Gnosis.\nSpells are not resisted but Withstood."},"Gameplay/Casting-a-spell-⚒️":{"title":"Casting a spell ⚒️","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Down and Dirty Spellcasting\nSometimes characters desire to cast spells or create effects that should be easy and require little risk or effort from the mage. Often these spells are effects that the mage creates on a regular basis, and the risk of failure is small and has little to no impact on the drama of the story. Determining spell factor penalties and Yantra bonuses for these kinds of spells is cumbersome. In these cases, just have players roll Gnosis + Arcanum. Success on the roll equals a successful casting. If the player wanted to affect multiple subjects, or create a large effect with the spellcasting, then the number of success may determine the number of subjects or the size of an area affected by the spell effect. For example, if a mage wanted to revive all the dead roses in a garden, she could roll Gnosis + Life and each success would equal a 5 meter radius of revived roses."},"Gameplay/Combat/Actions-Cheat-Sheet":{"title":"Actions Cheat Sheet","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a reference chart for actions the players might come up with that are not strictly in the rule set or are a combination of actions.\nMost of these is house rules and will be identified with 🏠.\nBasic Attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeDice PoolExamplesUnarmedStrength + Brawl - DefenseA punch, a kick, a headbuttMeleeStrength + Weaponry - DefenseAttacking with a sword, a baton, a baseball bat, a chair, etcRangedDexterity + FirearmsFiring a gun, a crossbow, an arrow with a bow, a bazooka, etcThrownDexterity + Athletics - DefenseThrowing a dagger, a knife, a rock, a chair, etc\nManeuvers\nDash\nUse your action to double your move speed for the turn.\nDodge\nUse your action to enter a dodging state. While dodging you have double defense but it’s not subtracted from the attack, instead it’s a dice pool where the successes reduces the attack dice pool successes (weapon damage is ignore at this step). For each defense, apply defense reduction before doubling it.\nExample:\n\nBruno gets into a fight against Marcos and Gustavo. He takes the first turn and enters dodge state, doubling his defense from 5 to 10.\nMarcos tries to punch him rolling a dice pool of 5d10 and gets 3 successes, Bruno rolls 10d10 for defense and gets 4 successes. Marcos punch misses. Bruno defense is now 8 [(5-1)x2].\nGustavo has a knife (+1 damage) and tries to stab Bruno, rolling a dice pool of 6d10 and having 4 successes, Bruno rolls 8d10 for defense and gets 3 successes. Gustavo stabs Bruno for 2 damage (4-3 successes + 1 knife damage). Bruno defense is now 6 [(4-1)x2].*\n\nAim\nSpend your turn aiming at a target and gain +1 die to an attack roll (max +3).

When the quake’s actually occurring, all Dexterity-based dice pools (and Defense) suffer a –1 to –5 penalty depending on the quake’s severity. Characters take between one and three points of lethal damage per turn of the quake’s duration, though a reflexive Stamina + Athletics roll can downgrade that damage to bashing — or cancel it entirely on an exceptional success.\nCausing the Tilt\nWithout tremendous supernatural power, it’s almost impossible to cause an earthquake. A character who detonates a powerful explosive underground might simulate the effects over a city-block for a few seconds.\nEnding the Tilt\nEarthquakes are fortunately very quick events. It’s very rare for one to last more than a minute (20 turns), so waiting them out is the best course of action."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️-Flooded":{"title":"🏞️ Flooded","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"Some liquid — brackish water, mud, gore, or raw sewage — is high enough to impede the character’s progress.\nEnvironmental Effect\nEach foot of liquid inflicts a –2 penalty to all Physical dice pools. If the water goes up over her head, a character has to swim (Dexterity + Athletics) with a penalty appropriate for the speed of flooding. Alternatively, she can try to hold her breath (Stamina + Composure) if she cannot get her head above the rising waters.\nCausing the Tilt\nNormally, this Tilt is the result of heavy rain, sudden snowmelt, or a broken water main. Characters can cause this Tilt by smashing up a water heater or blowing up a small dam. Some supernatural creatures may be able to call floods down onto a region.\nEnding the Tilt\nCharacters can escape flooding by getting to high ground, which is enough to mitigate this Tilt. A long-term fix would require draining the floodwaters, but each flood requires its own solution."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️-Heavy-Rain":{"title":"🏞️ Heavy Rain","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️-Flooded","Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/","Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️-Heavy-Winds"],"tags":[],"content":"Torrential rain lashes down in knives, bouncing high off the sidewalk. The sound of rain on the ground is a constant hammering rumble that goes on without end, like dropping ball bearings on a tin roof. Thick grey curtains of water obscure vision.\nEnvironmental Effect\nHeavy rains — approaching tropical storm levels or worse — cause a Perception penalty of –3 dice to both vision and hearing. Rain’s hard to see through, but it’s also loud. If the rains carry on for an hour or more, the 🏞️ Flooded Tilt will soon follow. This Tilt is often accompanied by 🏞️ Heavy Winds; a character trapped out in Heavy Rains might come under the effects of Extreme Cold.\nCausing the Tilt\nShort of supernatural power or a fleet of cloud-seeding aircraft, Heavy Rain is the result of natural weather patterns.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe best way out of the rain is to get indoors.

Powerful winds can toss cars around like toys. Anyone out in the winds feels like they’re taking a beating just for walking down the street.\nEnvironmental Effect\nHeavy winds are loud, so characters suffer a –3 modifier to aural Perception rolls. Also the wind inflicts a penalty to all Physical rolls when out in the winds — including Drive rolls. Grade the wind from one to five — one is tropical storm level (around 40 MPH), three is hurricane level (around 80 MPH), and five is tornado level (150+ MPH). This is the penalty applied to Physical dice rolls. Characters outside in the maelstrom take damage from flying debris, taking bashing damage each turn equal to the wind’s rating. Characters can make a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics roll to avoid damage.\nCausing the Tilt\nHeavy winds are a fact of life, from siroccos in the desert to tornados in the Midwest to wind shears everywhere.\nEnding the Tilt\nGetting out of the wind is the best way to end this Tilt. Sometimes that’s as easy as sheltering in an automobile — as long as nobody tries to drive.

The ice could be so thin as to be nearly invisible or a thick layer that’s the only thing keeping the characters from sinking into a frozen lake.\nEnvironmental Effect\nWhen a character can’t trust her footing, divide her Speed in half and all Physical rolls (and Defense) suffer a –2 penalty. Attempting to move at full Speed increases the Physical penalty to –4. Any dramatic failure on a Physical roll inflicts the 👤 Knocked Down Tilt.\nCausing the Tilt\nThis Tilt doesn’t just apply to icy conditions, but to any surface that’s slick and slippery, including a spill of industrial lubricant or just a really well-polished wooden or linoleum floor. Characters can use a Dexterity + Crafts roll to cover an area in industrial cleaner or mix up cleaning chemicals into a lubricant. If the Extreme Cold Tilt is in effect, even covering the area with water would do the trick.\nEnding the Tilt\n“Get off the ice” is good advice, but that can take work. Characters can use heat or fire to melt ice, or throw down copious quantities of salt or grit to increase traction."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️👤-Extreme-Cold":{"title":"🏞️👤 Extreme Cold","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"Bone-chilling winds bite through the character, or trudging through knee-deep snow takes all of the sensation from his limbs.\nAny time the temperature gets down below 0 degrees Celsius, a character can suffer from the cold’s effects. This Tilt can sometimes be personal, either as a result of a medical Condition such as hypothermia or a supernatural power.**\nEnvironmental Effect\nWhen the temperature is below freezing, characters can’t heal bashing damage — the extreme temperature deals damage at the same rate normal characters heal it (a cut might turn to frostbite, for instance). Supernatural beings and characters who heal faster than normal instead halve their normal healing rate. For every hour that a character is continuously affected by this Tilt, he accrues a –1 penalty to all rolls. When that penalty hits –5 dice, he instead suffers one point of lethal damage per hour.\nCausing the Tilt\nA character can suffer this Tilt from being in a frozen environment — whether he’s outside in the Arctic tundra or in a walk-in freezer. Inflicting the Tilt is reasonably straightforward: Throw the victim into a freezing lake or lock him in a freezer for long enough and he’ll develop hypothermia.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe best way to escape the freezing cold is to find a source of warmth — either a building with working heating, or warm bundled clothing. A character who has hypothermia requires medical attention."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️👤-Extreme-Heat":{"title":"🏞️👤 Extreme Heat","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"The character might be stumbling through the desert with the sun beating down on him, or running through the steam-tunnels surrounding an old boiler room.\nThis Tilt can also be personal, the result of a debilitating fever that spikes his temperature far above the norm. Extreme heat is normally anything above 45 degrees Celsius — this includes both environmental temperature and internal body temperature due to fever.\nEnvironmental Effect\nWhen the temperature is far above normal, characters can’t heal bashing damage — the extreme temperature deals damage at the same rate normal characters heal it (a cut might heal, but it’s replaced by sunburn or sunstroke). Supernatural beings and characters who heal faster than normal instead halve their normal healing rate. For every hour that a character is continuously affected by this Tilt, he accrues a –1 penalty to all rolls. When that penalty hits –5 dice, he instead suffers a point of lethal damage per hour.\nCausing the Tilt\nThis Tilt is usually caused by environmental factors — being out at noon in the desert or spending too long in a sauna or forge. Even a fever is the result of an infection, rather than something that an opponent can force on a character. It’s possible to create this Tilt on a given character: securing someone to a chair right next to an old, inefficient boiler, or stranding them in the desert far from any shade.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe key to ending this Tilt is simple: Get out of the heat. In a desert or similar environment, finding shade is paramount. Elsewhere, the character needs to escape whatever is causing the abnormal temperatures."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Arm-Wrack":{"title":"👤 Arm Wrack","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"Your arm burns with pain and then goes numb. It could be dislocated, sprained, or broken: whatever’s wrong with it, you can’t move your limb.\nEffect\nIf your arm’s broken or otherwise busted, you drop whatever you’re holding in that arm and can’t use it to attack opponents — unless you’ve got the Ambidextrous Merit, you suffer off-hand penalties for any rolls that require manual dexterity. If this effect spreads to both limbs, you’re down to a chance die on any rolls that require manual dexterity, and –3 to all other Physical actions.\nCausing the Tilt\nSome supernatural powers can cripple a victim’s limbs or break bones with a touch. A character can have his arm knocked out by a targeted blow to the arm (–2 penalty) that deals more damage than the character’s Stamina. A targeted blow to the hand inflicts this Tilt if it does any damage.\nEnding the Tilt\nIf the Tilt is inflicted as a result of an attack, mark an ‘x’ under the leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack; the Tilt ends when the damage that caused it has healed.

The player must spend a point of Willpower each time he wants the character to take a violent action in the fight. He can still run, Dodge, and apply Defense. If he wishes to take another action, the Storyteller should judge whether the action is aggressive enough to require the expenditure.\nCausing the Tilt\nThe character suffers bashing damage in excess of his Stamina or any amount of lethal damage.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe character surrenders and gives the aggressor what he wants. At this point, the character regains a point of Willpower and takes a Beat, but can take no further action in the fight. If the aggressor’s intent is to kill or injure the character, obviously surrender isn’t a good option."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Blinded":{"title":"👤 Blinded","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"The character’s eyes are damaged or removed, or the character is placed in a situation where eyesight is eliminated (a pitch-black room or a supernatural effect).\nEffect\nThe character suffers a –3 penalty to any rolls that rely on vision — including attack rolls — and halves his Defense if one eye is blinded. That penalty increases to –5 and losing all Defense if both eyes are affected.\nCausing the Tilt\nThe most common means of inflicting the tilt is to severely impair the target’s eyesight (using a blindfold, etc). An attacker can inflict temporary blindness by slashing at her opponent’s brow, throwing sand into his eyes, or kicking up dirt. This requires an attack roll of Dexterity + Athletics with a –3 penalty; the victim’s Defense applies to this attack. If it succeeds, the target is Blinded for the next turn.\nBlindness can also be inflicted by dealing damage to the target’s eyes — a specified attack with a –5 penalty. A successful attack normally damages one eye. It takes an exceptional success to totally blind an attacker.\nEnding the Tilt\nIf an attack against the character’s eye does any points of damage, mark an “x” under the leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack. If the damage inflicted is aggravated the character loses vision in that eye permanently. Otherwise, the Condition ends when the damage that caused the Tilt is healed."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Blizzard":{"title":"👤 Blizzard","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/","Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️-Heavy-Winds","Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/🏞️-Ice"],"tags":[],"content":"Heavy snowfall carpets the ground and just keeps falling, whipped up by howling winds into a barrage of whirling white.\nEnvironmental Effect\nBlizzards make it very hard to see for any real distance. Rolls to see things close to the character’s person, out to arm’s length away, suffer a –1 penalty. Each additional 10 yards inflicts an additional –1 penalty (cumulative) on all visual Perception rolls. This penalty also applies to ranged attack rolls. Moving through snow is difficult. Every four inches of snow applies a –1 penalty to appropriate Physical rolls, including combat rolls, Athletics, and so forth. The Blizzard Tilt rarely applies by itself — the Storyteller may also inflict any or all of the Extreme Cold, 🏞️ Heavy Winds, or 🏞️ Ice Tilts (all found below).\nCausing the Tilt\nThe weather is out of the control of most characters — but not necessarily mages. The Storyteller should telegraph an incoming natural blizzard before it hits, but some willworkers may be powerful enough to call down frozen hell from a clear blue sky.\nEnding the Tilt\nWithout supernatural powers, characters can’t “end” a blizzard. The best they can manage is to escape the weather or wait for it to stop. Proper equipment (such as goggles and snow boots) can add +1 to +3 to a roll, offsetting some of the penalties. If someone is causing this Tilt through a supernatural power, it’s possible that the characters could disrupt his concentration."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Deafened":{"title":"👤 Deafened","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"The character can’t hear. Maybe he’s suffering intense tinnitus or can only hear the roaring of blood in his ears, or he just plain can’t hear.\nEffect\nIf the character is deaf in one ear, he suffers a –3 penalty to hearing-based Perception rolls. A character who is struck deaf in both ears only gets a chance die on hearing-based Perception rolls, and suffers a –2 penalty to all combat-related dice rolls — suddenly losing the ability to hear the people around you is tremendously disorienting.\nCausing the Tilt\nA particularly loud noise within 10 feet of the character may cause temporary hearing loss as though the character were deaf in both ears. Alternatively, a targeted attack on the ear — at a –4 penalty — can deafen a character. Supernatural creatures with heightened senses can be deafened by loud noises at greater distances.\nEnding the Tilt\nDeafness from loud noises fades after 10 – (victim’s Stamina + Resolve) turns. If an attack against the character’s ear does any points of damage, mark an ‘x’ under the leftmost Health box inflicted in that attack. If the damage inflicted is aggravated, the character loses hearing in the ear permanently.

The character also ignores wound penalties.\nCausing the Tilt\nIf the character has chosen to take drugs, then he suffers the effects. To administer drugs to another character is a Dexterity + Weaponry attack, suffering a –1 modifier for the improvised weapon. If the drug has to go in to a specific body part (such as an arm or mouth), it requires an attack against a specified target.\nEnding the Tilt\nA generic narcotic lasts for 10 – (victim’s Stamina + Resolve) hours.

This could be a grappling opponent, a straightjacket wrapped with heavy chains, or a coffin secured on the outside with a padlock.\nEffect\nThe character can’t do anything but wriggle helplessly. He can’t apply Defense against incoming attacks and can’t take combat-related actions. If someone’s holding him down, he can spend a point of Willpower to deliver a head-butt or similar attack, but even that might not free him.\nCausing the Tilt\nThe usual way to inflict this Tilt is through the Restrain grappling move. This often uses material means to prevent the victim from moving, such as binding limbs with duct tape or zip-ties, tossing the victim into a car trunk or similar tight space, or applying painful holds and joint locks.\nEnding the Tilt\nAn Immobilized target can break free by escaping from a grapple or snapping whatever binds her. If grappled, the character can struggle as normal but can only select the Break Free move on a success. If held by an item, the character must make a Strength + Athletics roll penalized by the item’s Durability. If a character’s arms and legs are both bound, he suffers a –2 penalty; this increases to –4 if he’s hog-tied. On a success, he snaps the bindings or breaks free. Each roll, successful or not, deals a point of bashing damage."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Insane":{"title":"👤 Insane","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/","Instant-Action"],"tags":[],"content":"The character suffers from a panic attack, sudden imbalance, or a full-on psychotic break. Her pulse races and her mind cannot focus. The world’s an unstable place, and she’s unable to keep her balance.\nEffect\nSomeone suffering a psychotic break isn’t the sort of person to go down without a fight. Her stated intent might be irrational or just plain impossible, and she might have fewer ethical problems with using extreme violence to get what she wants. The character gains a +1 bonus to all combat rolls, but takes actions after everyone else (if two characters suffer from the Insane Tilt, both act after everyone else but compare Initiative as normal). A character suffering from this Tilt may spend Willpower, but the cost is two points instead of one for the same effect.\nCausing the Tilt\nFaced with extraordinary circumstances, any character with an appropriate Condition may gain the Insane Tilt. The Storyteller can call for a Resolve + Composure roll to resist a general anxiety that gnaws at the character’s mind; if the character fails, he gains the Tilt. If the character witnesses something truly horrific — a daughter watches her father walk to the end of the garden and shoot himself in the head, smiling all the while; a man stumbles into the wrong office at work and sees his co-workers feasting on the intern’s organs; a soldier sees her unit gunned down by a sniper while she can do nothing — the Storyteller can rule that the Tilt is unavoidable.\nThe Insane Tilt can also be triggered by a Breaking Point or Act of Hubris. If a character loses a dot of Wisdom or Integrity during combat, the Storyteller may apply the Insane Tilt then as well.\nSome supernatural creatures possess mind-affecting powers that can apply this Tilt, even to characters who do not have an appropriate Condition. This includes mages using the Mind Flay spell.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe specific effects of this Tilt don’t normally last beyond the end of the scene. A character can try to force her mind to a state of balance, but it’s not easy. She must sit and focus on blocking out the craziness. She rolls Resolve + Composure as an Instant Action contested by a dice pool of (10 – her Willpower). She can’t take any other actions that turn and doesn’t apply Defense against any attacks."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Insensate":{"title":"👤 Insensate","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/","Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Drugged"],"tags":[],"content":"The character shuts down, either due to extreme fear or sudden pleasure. He may huddle in a corner, cringe away from sudden noises, or stare into space as waves of pleasure lap over him.\nEffect\nThe character can’t take any actions until the Tilt is resolved. He can apply Defense to incoming attacks, and if he takes any damage from an attack, he’s knocked free of whatever fogged his brain.\nCausing the Tilt\nSeveral supernatural powers can leave their victim in a trance-like state of heightened emotion, whether it’s a vampire’s mind-affecting tricks or the pants-shitting terror of witnessing a werewolf take on an inhuman form. A truly heroic amount of alcohol or a hallucinogenic drug might have similar effects; administering such a drug is a Dexterity + Weaponry attack, suffering a –1 modifier for the improvised weapon.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe Tilt wears off at the end of the scene. The victim can spend a point of Willpower before then to act normally for one turn. A successful attack will also end the Tilt. If a character has been knocked insensible by drugs, this Tilt is replaced with the 👤 Drugged Tilt when it ends."},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/👤-Knocked-Down":{"title":"👤 Knocked Down","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Tilts/"],"tags":[],"content":"Something knocks the character to the floor, either toppling her with a powerful blow to the chest or taking one of her legs out from under her.\nEffect\nThe character is knocked off her feet. If she hasn’t already acted this turn, she loses her action. Once she’s on the ground, a character is considered prone. The character can still apply Defense against incoming attacks, and can attempt to attack from the ground at a –2 penalty.\nCausing the Tilt\nSome weapons list “Knockdown” as a special effect of a damaging hit. Otherwise, a melee weapon with a damage modifier of +2 or greater, or a firearm with a damage modifier of +3 or more can be used to knock a character down with the force of the blow. Alternatively, a melee weapon or unarmed attack can knock an opponent down with a targeted attack against the legs (–2 modifier). The attacker declares that he wants to knock his opponent down and halves the total damage done (rounding down). On a successful attack, the target is knocked down.\nEnding the Tilt\nThe easiest way to end this Tilt is to stand up, which takes an action.

For the purposes of this Tilt, a sickness is either “moderate” or “grave.” A moderate sickness, such as a cold, asthma, the flu, or just a bad hangover, causes a –1 penalty to all actions during combat. That penalty increases by one every two turns (the first two turns, the character suffers a –1 penalty, the next two turns the penalty is –2, and so on up to a maximum of –5 dice on turn 9). A grave sickness, such as pneumonia, heavy metal poisoning, or aggressive cancer, inflicts the same dice pool penalties as a mild sickness. In addition, however, the physical stress of fighting or even defending oneself from an attacker while gravely ill inflicts one point of bashing damage per turn of combat.\nCausing the Tilt\nIt’s not easy to deliberately make someone sick.

More than that, they seek to serve as soldiers and generals in this war, fighting to maintain their magic. Arrows are the guardians and wardens of the Pentacle, warriors of the Diamond, fighting against stagnation and complacency. They typically hold a majority of non-leadership roles in Consilia and Convocations (and no few Assemblies), as community-oriented duties find fulfillment within their philosophy. Above all else, their magic calls for dedication: striving for a chosen goal against meaningful opposition.\nMages join this Order when…\nThey want to define themselves by supporting others, learn self-discipline and control over their magic, come from a martial or regimented background and want to keep that ethos, or believe magic should be wielded with honor and responsibility.\nCore Beliefs: The Adamant Way\nThe Adamant Way can be divided into five precepts — the Hand — just as five fingers make a fist. The metaphor is simple: Hands are the primary gates for the sense of touch and the means to work one’s will; they create or destroy in equal measure, translating human desire into physicality.\nExistence is War\nThe Way teaches improvement through opposition and restraint, evincing a universal state of affairs that is self-evident. All beings struggle for life, and all Awakened souls struggle against the Abyss to bridge the Supernal and Fallen. Vying for self-expression, Awakened souls grow stronger by conquering the desires of other souls. Arrows are warriors, though not always martial ones — to a one, they seek challenge and conflict, though their competitions are often friendly. The Order as a whole regards true pacifists with disgust, but they’re not bellicose — peace can be a far greater challenge to achieve than petty bloodshed.\nAdaptability is Strength\nArrows understand that nothing worth doing is achieved with ease, and that limitations are self-imposed. Attack and defense, spell and sword are valuable individually, but mere components of the whole. Predictability and inflexibility are dangerous in a world of sympathetic magic, and crippling to the soul. An Arrow rises beyond these weaknesses and toward a balanced and perfected self.\nService is Mastery\nControl only ever extends as far as the self — your nature and soul are the only things truly yours and yours alone. Honest service lies not in becoming the power behind the throne, but in limiting one’s ambition, pride, and guilt as external factors in one’s control. Until the Arrow sets aside his desires for another’s, all of his high ideals are mere justifications for his own actions. Once he abandons his selfishness, he understands his place in the universe, serving the Supernal as well as himself.\nThe Supernal is the Self\nMind and soul are a microcosm of the universe and magic. Every trial by adversity reinforces the mage’s honor and self-integrity. The mage is her magic, as inseparable as a hand’s identity from owner’s intent, growing closer to her spiritual ideal with every victory. Arrows often seek to shed their personal flaws by swearing oaths to tie themselves to purposes larger than the self. Oaths declare intent to the universe and sharpen focus on the challenge at hand, whether promising to defend a dear friend or murder a hated rival. A sworn Arrow is placing her judgment in dynamic action rather than formal words.\nEnlightenment is Honor\nA warrior’s soul that expresses her intentions, then accomplishes those specific aims, reveals a vision unimpeded by distractions and uncompromised by the Fallen World. Challenges are more worthy when the challenger restricts his options to the path he chooses to fulfill his goals. Honorable mages act in accordance with their ideals, in true harmony with their perfect selves.\nMysteries\nArrows look for Mysteries that threaten their charges, seeking to understand malicious magic with superior knowledge and craft intent to better end the threat. They seek to aid other Diamond Orders in the often-perilous experience of investigating their own Mysteries. Alternately, an Arrow will swear oaths to uncover a secret, proving dominance with self-mastery by pitting herself against a singular foe. An attractive Mystery for an Arrow involves a test or contest of his skill; Arrows are disappointed when the Fallen World gives up its secrets too easily.\nMagical Symbolism: Attack and Defense\nThe Arrow doesn’t consider all wars to be martial, but more often than not their symbolism relies on weaponry, tools that extend power in the realm of physical combat. In a philosophy based on eternal war, a weapon must be at hand at all times. Arrow tools favor the sword or the pistol, two weapons that have no other use than to take a life, though this is more a preference than anything else — after all, adaptability is strength, and anything than can be wielded as a weapon by the average person has a place in Arrow symbolism. Besides armor and other protective gear, charms that protect the user from physical or spiritual harm also feature prominently among Arrow tools — amulets, dreamcatchers, bandolier bags.\r\nIn the ideal Awakened society postulated by the Diamond’s Atlantean symbolism, the Adamantine Arrow embodies Ungula Draconis, the Talon of the Dragon: righteous warriors who fight to keep the flame of human power alive in an age of darkness.\nHubris\nArrows fall afoul of hubris when they overestimate their abilities and create Paradoxes trying to extricate themselves, or when they’re confronted with their own weakness and deficiencies. It’s also easy for an efficient Arrow to assume he’s conquered all his challenges simply because he tightly manages his life, forgetting that the Order’s truths lie in constant conflict. Dedicated Arrows find it easy to mistake disdain for avoiding necessary fights as willingness to forsake peaceful ends. Violence must always be a solution, but it is rarely the best solution, so an Arrow grows hubristic when she loses sight of this. Life to a member of the Order isn’t so important when forced to choose between existence and integrity, but hubristic Arrows regard keeping your word as more important than human lives and morality\r\nLastly, the Order prides itself on being above politics, focused on their ideals of service. When an Arrow assumes power, it is when they are the strongest and most capable of facing down a threat. To them, it is prudence, not power: merely choosing a side can define and shape the political arena. Hubristic Arrow mages eschew guardianship to seize power for themselves under the guise of being able defenders.\nRelation to other Orders\nGuardians - Regrettably necessary, but untrustworthy, even if we’re on the same side.\r\nMysterium - Keepers of what we protect.

Space also allows a mage to manipulate the sympathetic connection between subjects.\nPurview\r\nDistance, separation, sympathy, conjuration, scrying, warding\nKeys\nSince the Space Arcanum’s purview includes portals, doors, and similar liminal spaces, it’s only natural that many Space spells allow the mage to specify a Key — a particular item carried, password spoken, or other criterion that either activates a spell or bypasses its effects. For example, a portal might only open on the summer solstice, or a hidden path might be visible to anyone of the mage’s bloodline. Spells that can be Keyed are called out below, usually at the cost of a Reach. The Key may have a number of requirements equal to the spell’s Potency.\nSympathy\nSpace allows a mage to manipulate, destroy, and create from nothing the occult bonds of sympathy. The concept of sympathy is a complex one, and the libraries of the Orders contain volumes on the subject, but briefly: Two subjects may become sympathetically linked when they share a strong emotional, physical, or mystical connection. Naturally-occurring links are sometimes permanent, but just as often fade over time: a brief but passionate love affair’s link might fade within a few weeks of the breakup, while a murder weapon retains links to both killer and victim for years.\r\nSympathetic links manipulated with the Space Arcanum echo from the Supernal to the Fallen, wreaking subtle but long-standing changes in the subjects. Sever a man’s link to his husband and the relationship cools and grows distant. Create a bond between a woman and a gun, and she’ll find herself thinking about it, dreaming about it — and left to their own devices odds are good woman and gun will cross paths.\r\nThis isn’t precisely mind control, or even an expression of Fate magic: all Space can do is manipulate the connections, not control reactions or guarantee outcomes. Maybe the chilled couple seeks counseling and repairs their relationship. Maybe the woman tells herself she’s being crazy and deliberately ignores thoughts of firearms. The point is that playing with people’s sympathetic links has a real, tangible effect on their lives. The Wise look askance on those mages who endeavor to cull their own sympathetic “vulnerabilities” with good reason.\r\nMost spells dealing with sympathy use the connections themselves as the spells’ subjects, and are Withstood by the links’ relative strength — deeper bonds are more difficult to affect. Mages with Space 2 or more can also use links to cast other spells on subjects not within sensory range, by routing their magic along the lines of sympathy using an Attainment. In these cases, the spell is Withstood by Space itself; weaker connections are more difficult to use.\r\nWhen affecting links with magic, each connection is treated as a subject for purposes of spell factors. For example, a spell that dampens a sympathetic connection can dampen multiple connections by increasing the Scale factor.\nSympathetic Names\nIn the womb, a human being has only a Connected link to her mother and a Strong one to her genetic father. At birth, this shifts to a Strong link to both parents and other primary caregivers, whether related or not, but babies don’t otherwise form sympathetic links until the sense of self develops. Once the Lie sets in that the world is separate from the self, a child begins to form her own links. Even in adulthood, everyone’s sympathetic links bear a permanent reminder of that early time — the name that those with links to a baby think of her as becomes indelibly marked in her Pattern as her sympathetic name.\r\nNo matter how many times a person changes her name through childhood and adulthood, once she forms links of her own the sympathetic name is set, and is both weakness and protection — speaking a person’s sympathetic name counts as a Yantra as per p.119, but not knowing it makes affecting her at range more difficult, increasing the Withstand level against the Sympathetic Range Attainment by one."},"Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Spirit":{"title":"Spirit","links":["tags/arcana","tags/spellcasting","tags/spirit"],"tags":["arcana","spellcasting","spirit"],"content":"arcanaspellcastingspirit\nThe subtle Arcanum of the Primal Wilds deals with repercussions: What we do in this world has echoes that we cannot see or hear or feel, but which are no less real for all that. Spirit mages understand those repercussions, and know that it falls to them to act as intercessors between the Visible and the Invisible. Spirit’s purview is the Shadow Realm and its denizens, the spirits. The flows of Essence that empower them and the Gauntlet that holds them apart from our world also fall under this Arcanum’s dominion.\nPurview\r\nEssence, spirits, the Shadow, the Gauntlet\nThe Gauntlet\nThe membrane between worlds isn’t a simple barrier, but a medium of its own that those crossing between material and Shadow have to push through. The Gauntlet’s Strength or thickness depends on a wide range of factors in both worlds, not all of which a mage can know. The Gauntlet is generally strengthened by the presence of humans. The tumult of human emotion and activity keeps the worlds of Flesh and Spirit apart, and simultaneously generates new spirits and the Essence they feed on. Any spell cast on a subject on the other side of the Gauntlet or on the Gauntlet itself is Withstood by the Gauntlet Strength. If the Gauntlet Strength at the caster’s location and the Gauntlet Strength at the subject’s location are different, apply the lower value (the mage can either direct the Supernal energies to cross the Gauntlet and then seek out the subject, or vice versa). If a mage casts on a subject she can see across the Gauntlet in real time (e.g. with the Reach effect of the Exorcist’s Eye spell), it counts as viewing that subject remotely.\nGauntlet Strength\nGauntlet Strength is both a number and a dice modifier. Mages mainly use the strength number, while some mechanics use the modifier, such as spirits using the Reaching Manifestation to use their powers across the Gauntlet. The following chart isn’t a definitive guide to Gauntlet Strength; areas of high or low activity can create thin or thick spots — a deserted graveyard in an inner-city borough, for example, may have a lower Gauntlet than the surrounding blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocationStrengthDice ModifierDense urban areas5–3City suburbs, towns4–2Small towns, villages3–1Wilderness, countryside20Locus1+2Verge0n/a"},"Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Time":{"title":"Time","links":["tags/arcana","tags/spellcasting","tags/time"],"tags":["arcana","spellcasting","time"],"content":"arcanaspellcastingtime\nTime and Fate rule Arcadia; Time is the gross Arcanum of the pair, governing the progression of events through the ever-advancing present in a way perpendicular to Fate’s subtlety. Some Acanthus liken Time to a loosed arrow, and Fate to the archer’s aim. Time governs the history and diverse potential futures of the Fallen World. All things must pass. Legends rise and fall. Even gods die and fade into obscurity. Nothing is eternal, save perhaps for time itself.\nPurview\r\nProphecy, change, postcognition, time travel, time contraction and dilation\nSpinning the Thread of Time\nSleeper philosophers and scientists debate and make inferences about the nature of Time, discussing theoretical problems and paradoxes, measuring the distortion in the light of distant stars, but always knowing that they are locked into Time’s endless march. Mages who study the Time Arcanum have practical experience to marry to Sleeping theory, and quickly discover that while some thinkers have approached something like the truth, thought experiments don’t fully prepare them for the reality of temporal magic. Sleepers often describe time as a river, but traditional Acanthus instead describe it as a spinning wheel, gathering strands of unspun material and binding them into a tight thread.\nThe Future is Unwritten\nThe unspun material in the metaphor, the future is protean and ever-changing. Using Time spells to access the future only reveals the most likely future at the time the spell is cast, and foreknowledge can and often does then immediately change the outcome. Advanced Time spells rewrite the future like any other Pattern, dictating how immediate events will go or constructing theoretical futures mages then examine and let dissipate into the shifting flow of probability.\nThe Past can be Rewritten\nIn contrast, the past is like the spun thread — set and decided, unless magic alters it. Sleepers theorize about temporal paradoxes; if someone goes back in time to avert a disaster and succeeds, surely they would never then have to travel back, so would never have changed events? Magic defies causality; a mage who travels back in time can alter the cause of his own trip and more, the magic accounting for any contradiction caused. When an object or person is in the past, the distortion is visible to onlookers using Active Mage Sight with Time, and as she changes history everything she alters also picks up a telltale temporal aura.\r\nWhen a time traveler returns to the present, any changes he made to the timeline “set,” becoming Lasting, and the distortions vanish. Dying while in the past “sets” any changes made up to that point. Travelers are insulated against the alterations of history; a mage who prevents her own birth returns to a world that does not know her, but does not vanish from existence. While still in the past, if the spell that projected the traveler backwards is dispelled, he returns to the present but any changes he made to history are reversed.\nHistories Unwritten\nThe principle drawback of time travel in a Storytelling game is that the time traveler doesn’t undo just her actions, but those of the other player characters as well. This problem is exacerbated when only one character has access to time travel. If a player has gained a Beat through circum- stances that are then erased, the Beat doesn’t vanish. If that player’s character earns more Beats by different means in the second version of events, those Beats stay as well.\nTemporal Sympathy\nThe “spun” time of the past is both more certain and useful to examine with magic but harder to affect, as a mage must contend with the weight of all the intervening history. Much as two subjects may have sympathetic links crossing Space marking how magically related they are, a subject has temporal sympathy with its own past selves, which influences magic used with a past version of an object, place, or thing as its subject. The more a subject has changed in the intervening time, the harder it is for a mage to look back at it but the easier it is to affect that sympathy itself. Just as Space magic that alters sympathetic links has consequences for the people or objects concerned, manipulating temporal sympathy can provoke subtle effects; increase a woman’s temporal sympathy with her youth and she’ll become highly nostalgic, perhaps trying to recapture it. Destroy a building’s temporal sympathy with its past and people will forget its history. Magic that affects the “unspun” time of the future is unaffected by temporal sympathy; the shifting potential timelines have no “substance” for magic to contend with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal SympathyDescriptionWithstand (connection)Withstand (temporal sympathy)UnchangedThe subject has not changed with intervening time.

Mages who travel back in time and look forward find that the intervening span is still set, spun from probability to realized future history. While it may be their subjective future, it’s in the Fallen World’s past. From their perspective, the present is frozen at the moment they left — if they “catch up” to it, anything they changed becomes real, and the normal flow of time resumes.

This bonus accumulates with each roll, so the third roll made for a mage within a scene has a +2 modifier.+1One or more Sleepers witness an obvious casting of magic.-2The mage uses a dedicated magical tool during the casting.-1The mage spends a point of Mana. (see below)\nCertain Conditions affecting the mage may also modify the Paradox dice pool. A mage may reflexively spend Mana to mitigate the chance of a Paradox, removing one Paradox die per Mana spent in this manner. The mage cannot spend more Mana then she is normally allowed to spend per turn — including the amount of Mana that is spent for the spellcasting itself — though she can spend the Mana over multiple turns prior to casting the spell.\nMultiple Sleeper witnesses do not add Paradox dice, but increase the chances of a Paradox occurring. If a few Sleepers witness the magic casting, the Paradox roll gains the 9-Again quality, a large group grants the Paradox roll the 8-Again quality, and a full crowd grants the Paradox roll the rote quality.\nBefore the Paradox dice pool is rolled, the mage must decide whether to contain the Paradox within her own soul or release it and hope for the best. If she attempts to contain it, she will potentially suffer pain and injury — or worse effects — as the Abyss warps her very being. If she does not contain it, she will be safer, but the Paradox may warp her spell. Containing a Paradox is completely voluntary, and a mage cannot be forced to do so.\nReleasing\nIf the mage does not attempt to contain the Paradox, the Storyteller rolls the Paradox pool:\n\nDramatic Failure : The mage does not invoke a Paradox, regains a point of Willpower, and the next Paradox roll made for her in the same scene does not suffer the usual, cumulative +1 dice modifier.\nFailure : The mage does not invoke a Paradox.\nSuccess : A Paradox occurs, regardless of the spellcasting’s success or failure.\nExceptional Success : The mage gains a Paradox Condition and a Paradox occurs.\n\nIf a single success is rolled on the Paradox dice, a Paradox occurs. The Abyss taints the spell and, potentially, the area around the spell’s subject. The Paradox imposes a dice penalty to the spellcasting roll equal to its successes. Whether or not this makes the spell fail, a Paradox anomaly occurs. If the spellcasting results in a dramatic failure, the mage incurs a Paradox Condition as well.\nTo create an anomaly, the Storyteller utilizes the number of successes gained on the Paradox roll as Reach on a one to one basis to affect the spell. The Storyteller can use Paradox Reach to change the spell factors of the spell, to create Abyssal taint on the environment, or to summon an Abyssal entity.\nStorytellers can spend Reach however they like to affect the spell, using up all the Reach to warp the spell into something very different from what the mage intended, or leaving the spell as-is and instead producing Abyssal wastelands around the spell’s subject. The Paradox effect should reflect the type of spell being cast. Attack spells may rebound and hit an innocent subject, or split and hit multiple subjects. Healing spells may heal the subject, but create a blighted patch on the ground nearby. A mage may succeed in making herself invisible, but summon a Gulmoth in her wake. A Paradox anomaly’s duration depends on the Wisdom tier of the caster who invokes it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisdomParadoxEnlightenedOne SceneUnderstandingOne Chapter/DayFallingOne Story/MonthMad OneOne Chronicle/Year\nContaining\nIf the mage decides to contain the Paradox within her soul, the player contests the Paradox roll by rolling the character’s Wisdom dots as a dice pool, contesting the Paradox roll. Each success on the Wisdom roll cancels out one success on the Paradox roll. Each Paradox success canceled out in this way deals one resistant bashing wound to the mage. If the Paradox roll still succeeds, the spell is not penalized and does not create an anomaly as with released Paradoxes. Instead, the character gains a Paradox Condition. The severity of the Paradox Condition is based on the number of remaining successes gained on the Paradox roll.\nParadox Conditions\nParadox Conditions can only be gained in one of the following ways — obtaining a dramatic failure when casting a spell after incurring a Paradox, netting an exceptional success on a released Paradox roll, or failing to fully contain a Paradox. Each one has two resolution mechanics. The first requires the character to actively accept the negative consequence of the Paradox, and the other is to allow the Paradox to lapse. A Paradox Condition lapses after an amount of time determined by the character’s Wisdom if she does not take action to resolve the Condition. Until the Condition is resolved or lapses, the mage cannot use magic to mitigate the effects of the Paradox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisdomDuration of Paradox ConditionEnlightenedOne Story/MonthUnderstandingOne Chapter/DayFallingOne SceneMad OneOne Turn\nAbyssal Nimbus\nThe mage’s Nimbus is disfigured by the Abyss, the corruption cascading through her sympathetic links. The mage, and any subjects affected by her Nimbus (including sympathetic ties influenced by her Long-Term Nimbus, anyone affected by her Nimbus Tilt, and anything imprinted with her Signature Nimbus), gain the Resonant Condition applicable to Abyssal entities. If the Paradox roll that inflicted this Condition rolled an exceptional success, she gains the Open Condition instead.\nIn addition, the Abyssal corruption is readily apparent to anyone who scrutinizes her Signature Nimbus, and her Long-Term Nimbus effects become twisted by the unreality of the Abyss. A Moros’ Long-Term Nimbus might cause bizarre materials with impossible atomic properties to appear, while the religious revelations of an Obrimos’ Nimbus take on a nihilistic tone.\n\nResolution : An Abyssal Entity uses the Condition to Manifest, the mage Scours the Condition from her Pattern, or the mage allows the Condition to lapse after the specified time.\nArcane Beat : Gain an Arcane Beat when this Condition lapses.\n\nAbyssal Imago\nThe Abyss has warped the mage’s ability to clearly envision her Supernal will. Whenever the mage casts a spell, she must spend additional Reach equal to the successes earned on the Paradox roll that inflicted this condition. If she does not, the spell automatically fails and adds dice equal to the caster’s spellcasting dice pool to the Paradox roll.\n\nResolution : The mage successfully casts a spell that does not risk Paradox, the mage Scours the Condition from her Pattern, or the mage allows the Condition to lapse after the specified time.\nArcane Beat : Gain an Arcane Beat when this Condition lapses.\n\nAbyssal Backlash\nThe mage has drawn the attention of a vast Abyssal intelligence called an Annunaki, which seeks to corrupt the mage’s spells further. The next time the mage casts a spell that risks Paradox, add dice to the Paradox pool equal to the number of successes earned on the Paradox roll that inflicted this condition.\n\nResolution : The mage fully contains a Paradox, the mage Scours the Condition from her Pattern, or the mage allows the Condition to lapse after the specified time.\nArcane Beat : Gain an Arcane Beat when this Condition lapses.\n"},"Magic--and--Concepts/Practices":{"title":"Practices","links":["tags/spellcasting","tags/leveling","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Fate","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Mind","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Spirit","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Death","/","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Space","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Forces","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Prime","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Matter","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Time","Magic--and--Concepts/Arcanas/Life"],"tags":["spellcasting","leveling"],"content":"spellcastingleveling\nMages divide the art of magic into thirteen Practices of increasing complexity. Demonstrating their expertise with these methodologies is how mages claim rank and privilege: A Thyrsus who has demonstrated the ability to cast Spirit Unmaking spells has earned the right to call herself a Master, for example. When they require further gradation, mages specify the number of Arcana they have achieved their highest rank in: if the same Thyrsus also successfully casts a Life Making spell she may call herself a second-degree Master\n\nInitiate (•)\nCompelling\nCompelling spells nudge a preferred but possible outcome into reality. A coin toss can be made to come up tails (Fate), a bored worker can be made to take that coffee break now (Mind), or a spirit can be forced to avoid its bane (Spirit). Making the coin hover and spin in midair, making the worker walk into her boss’s office and quit, or making the spirit ignore its favorite prey are beyond the bounds of a Compelling spell.\nKnowing\nKnowing spells deliver knowledge about something directly to the mage (or to another target). A mage can divine the cause of a corpse’s death (Death), sense whether someone has a powerful destiny (), or unerringly know which way is north (Space). This knowledge is a direct awareness of Supernal truth; the mage doesn’t have to interpret evidence based on her senses or try to divine the truth out of cryptic riddles.\nUnveiling\nUnveiling spells expose hidden things to the mage’s senses. She might gain the ability to hear radio waves (Forces), peer across the Gauntlet or perceive things in Twilight (Spirit), or see the flow of Mana across the landscape (Prime).\n\nApprentice (••)\nRulling\nRuling spells grant fuller control over phenomena than a mere Compelling spell. Water can be made to flow uphill or into unnatural shapes (Matter), animals (or even human beings) can be commanded (Life or Mind), or time can be momentarily made to accelerate or slow down (Time). A Ruling spell can’t fundamentally alter its target’s abilities: Water can be directed, but not turned solid or gaseous. Time can be altered, but not overwritten. An animal can be commanded, but not made stronger or fiercer.\nShielding\nShielding spells, sometimes called Warding spells, offer protection against phenomena under the Arcanum’s purview. A Shielding spell might protect against a ghost’s Numina (Death), make the mage immune to fire (Forces) or disease (Life), or allow her to survive in a caustic atmosphere (Matter). Mages protect themselves from general harm through the power of their Arcana with the Mage Armor Attainment rather than Shielding spells.\nVeiling\nVeiling spells are twofold: Firstly, they can conceal things under the Arcanum’s purview from detection: A target can be made to lose all sense of time (Time), a fire’s heat and light can be hidden from view (Forces), or a building made all but impossible to notice (Matter). Secondly, they can conceal a target from concrete phenomena under the Arcanum’s purview: a mage can render herself invisible to ghosts (Death), or ward a powerful Locus from detection by spirits (Spirit), or walk unnoticed through a crowd (Life or Mind), or past a camera (Forces). Short of archmastery, it’s impossible to Veil something against an abstract concept or force: a mage can’t Veil herself against death or hide from time, for example\n\nDisciple (•••)\nFraying\nFraying spells degrade things, weakening them and enhancing their flaws. Fraying spells can weaken targets under the Arcanum’s purview: damping a fire (Forces), sapping Strength (Life), or eroding the barrier between worlds (Death, Spirit, or others, depending on the worlds in question). They can also directly attack targets using the energies of the Arcanum: inflicting damage via the chill of the grave (Death), psychic overload (Mind), or a blast of electricity (Forces). Damage inflicted by a direct-attack Fraying spell is always bashing.\nPerfecting\nPerfecting spells are the opposite of Fraying spells in many ways: they bolster, strengthen, and improve rather than weakening and eroding. A Perfecting spell might repair damage to an object or a person (Matter or Life), allow a machine to function perfectly with no wear and tear (Matter), or make a modest destiny into an earth-shaking one ().\nWeaving\nWeaving spells can alter nearly any property of a target without transforming it into something completely different. Solid steel can be transmuted to liquid (Matter), a sword can be enchanted to damage beings in Twilight (Death or Spirit), or a few seconds of time can be rewritten (Time).\n\nAdept (••••)\nPatterning\nPatterning spells allow a mage to completely transform a target into something else that falls under the Arcanum’s purview. A memory can be replaced wholesale (Mind), the mage can turn herself (or a target) into an animal (Life), or she can teleport by “rewriting” her own location (Space). A spell that transforms the target into something that falls within the Purview of another Arcanum, like transforming into a living pillar of fire (Life and Forces), requires a mage to know the Practice of Patterning for the destination Arcanum.\nUnraveling\nUnraveling spells can significantly impair or damage phenomena under the Arcanum’s purview, or directly inflict severe damage using the forces of an Arcanum. A raging storm might become a calm summer’s day (Forces), or solid iron reduced to dust (Matter); even spells can be torn asunder (Prime). Mages can hurl fire (Forces) at their enemies, or cause aneurysms and heart attacks with a glance (Mind or Life). Damage inflicted by a direct Unraveling attack is lethal, but can be upgraded to aggravated by spending a point of Mana and one Reach.\n\nMaster (•••••)\nMaking\nMaking spells allow for the creation of whole new phenomena ex nihilo. The mage can conjure gamma rays (Forces), birth new spirits (Spirit), or create a doorway to the Underworld (Death). Time can be dilated by creating more seconds, hours, or even days (Time).\nUnmaking\nUnmaking spells annihilate subjects under the Arcanum’s purview entirely. Life can be snuffed like a candle (Life), two locations can be forced into each other by destroying the distance between them (Space), even Hallows and Verges can be wiped from the Earth (Prime). Unmaking spells are beyond inflicting direct damage with attacks; a successful Unmaking destroys the target altogether."},"Seers-of-the-Throne":{"title":"Seers of the Throne","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Tilts":{"title":"Tilts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Translations":{"title":"Translations","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"title":"index","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Mage, The Awakening - Second Edition Easy Wiki"},"Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"🛣️-Roadmap":{"title":"🛣️ Roadmap","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This roadmap list the next features/updates to this wiki IN ORDER of priority, top to bottom, high to low.\n\nTilts explanations\nConditions explanation + list\nSimplify the Paradox concepts and mechanics with examples\nAdd Act of Hubris section with simplified concept and examples\nAdd Breaking Point section with simplified concept and examples\nAdd remaining Orders\nAdd section for the concept of Orders\nAdd section for the concept of Legacies\nAdd Legacies\n"},"Lore/Orders/Atlantean-Diamond/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Lore/Orders/Atlantean-Diamond/index":{"title":"index","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"⚒️-Act-of-Hubris":{"title":"⚒️ Act of Hubris","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"TO-DO"},"Gameplay/⚒️-Act-of-Hubris":{"title":"⚒️ Act of Hubris","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"TO-DO"},"🛠️Breaking-Point":{"title":"🛠️Breaking Point","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"⚒️-Breaking-Point":{"title":"⚒️ Breaking Point","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"TO-DO"},"Gameplay/⚒️-Breaking-Point":{"title":"⚒️ Breaking Point","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"TO-DO"},"Gameplay/Mechanics/Actions-timings":{"title":"Actions timings","links":["Gameplay/Mechanics/Withstand"],"tags":[],"content":"Instant Actions\nTakes about 2 seconds. Most actions are Instant Actions.\nReflexive Action\nA reflexive action is the sort of thing you don’t even need to think about doing. Most rolls to resist supernatural powers are reflexive. You can take a reflexive action at any time, and it doesn’t take your turn in combat.\nContested Action\nHappens when 2 (or more) people fight over an specific goal, like grappling vs trying to scape, a tug of war, etc.\nYou roll your dice pool and the Storyteller (or other player) rolls the dice pool for the other party. Whoever rolls the most successes is the victor.\nExceptional success still apply to the winner when the number of successes is 5 or higher.\nSpells are not usually Contested but Withstood.\nExtended Actions\nAn extended action is an attempt to complete a complex task. You roll your dice pool multiple times. Each roll takes a certain amount of time, and represents a step in the process — your character either makes significant progress or faces a setback. You determine your dice pool for the action as normal — Attribute + Skill + Modifiers. Make a note of your Attribute + Skill + Specialty (if any); that’s the maximum number of times you can roll before the action fails.\nWhen you take an extended action, the Storyteller determines how many successes you require. Most actions require between five and twenty successes. Five reflects a reasonable action that competent characters can achieve with the right tools and knowledge. Ten represents a difficult action that’s still realistic for a professional in a field. Twenty represents a very difficult action that even a particularly skilled character will have trouble pulling off.\nThe Storyteller also determines the interval between rolls. If an action would take weeks to complete, she might consider one roll per week. If it’s likely to take a day’s work, one roll per hour makes for a solid timeframe.\nResistance to actions\nSometimes, an action is resisted. You roll your Attribute + Skill, but apply a modifier of one of your opponent’s Resistance Attributes (Resolve, Stamina, or Composure), or your opponent’s Defense. This resistance is over and above any other modifiers applied to the dice pool.\nWhen uncanny powers other than Awakened magic are involved, they may be resisted or contested as noted in their rules. Supernatural creatures can sometimes add an additional trait, called Supernatural Tolerance. The Supernatural Tolerance trait for Mages is Gnosis.\nSpells are not resisted but Withstood."},"Gameplay/⚒️-Casting-a-spell":{"title":"⚒️ Casting a spell","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Down and Dirty Spellcasting\nSometimes characters desire to cast spells or create effects that should be easy and require little risk or effort from the mage. Often these spells are effects that the mage creates on a regular basis, and the risk of failure is small and has little to no impact on the drama of the story. Determining spell factor penalties and Yantra bonuses for these kinds of spells is cumbersome. In these cases, just have players roll Gnosis + Arcanum. Success on the roll equals a successful casting. If the player wanted to affect multiple subjects, or create a large effect with the spellcasting, then the number of success may determine the number of subjects or the size of an area affected by the spell effect. For example, if a mage wanted to revive all the dead roses in a garden, she could roll Gnosis + Life and each success would equal a 5 meter radius of revived roses."},"Gameplay/Combat/Combat-Actions-Cheat-Sheet":{"title":"Combat Actions Cheat Sheet","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a reference chart for actions the players might come up with that are not strictly in the rule set or are a combination of actions.\nMost of these is house rules and will be identified with 🏠.\nBasic Attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeDice PoolExamplesUnarmedStrength + Brawl - DefenseA punch, a kick, a headbuttMeleeStrength + Weaponry - DefenseAttacking with a sword, a baton, a baseball bat, a chair, etcRangedDexterity + FirearmsFiring a gun, a crossbow, an arrow with a bow, a bazooka, etcThrownDexterity + Athletics - DefenseThrowing a dagger, a knife, a rock, a chair, etc\nManeuvers\nDash\nUse your action to double your move speed for the turn.\nDodge\nUse your action to enter a dodging state.
